Code for Software Engineering (CS 3733) at WPI. 

The task was to make a frontend and backend for a task managing app where a user can manage a team and various tasks.
Users can add/remove members and tasks, assign tasks to members and due dates, create subtasks, and more.
The majority of the components (front end hosting, databases, lambda functions) were hosted using AWS.
